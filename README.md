### “The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.” - Paul Graham

- 🔭 I’m currently working on few of my projects and trying to contribute to the ones I like
- 🌱 I like to explore ideas and learn whatever squanders my flow, if you have something to teach me I'm in!
- 💬 Ask me about Web Development, App Development and Design
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am working on a social network of my own


My drive is innovation and that's really what I want to do all my life. I would use github to show my progress in building stuff I like with programming technologies. Since the begining of my childhood I am rambling to find tools to help me build things and programming is one such great tool. I try to tap into ideas and learn with the flow, that's a really impatient way go with it but you know... whatever works for you. Looking to learn from whoever I could so I can achieve cool things on shoulders of giants.
