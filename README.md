### “The recipe for great work is: very exacting taste, plus the ability to gratify it.” - Paul Graham

- 🔭 I’m currently working on few of my projects and trying to contribute to the ones I like
- 🌱 I like to explore stuff and learn whatever hinders my flow.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am working on a social network of my own


My drive is innovation and that's really what I want to do all my life. Since my childhood I am rambling to find tools to help me build things and programming is one such great tool. I like learning by doing, that's a really impatient way go with it but you know... whatever works for you.
